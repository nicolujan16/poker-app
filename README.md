# 🃏 Online Poker Room

A real-time multiplayer poker web app built with React, Firebase Realtime Database, and AWS Lambda.

This project simulates an online poker room where players can create private rooms, join ongoing games, and play poker together in real time.  
The app handles card dealing and game logic securely on the server side using AWS Lambda, ensuring that each player only sees their own cards while the rest remain hidden.

The frontend is built with React and uses Firebase Realtime Database to keep the game state synchronized across all players.
